    # Note: Spin is different in Python. In C++, we had to spinOnce because that
    # was what enabled our services and stuff to be called; it is single-threaded.
    # In Python, services and subscribers are automatically launched in threads.
    # Thus, we do not need to spin! Instead, the rospy.spin() simply waits until
    # rospy is shutdown. In other words, you can:
    # 1. Register a service and call rospy.spin().
    # 2. Create a while loop with rospy.is_shutdown() and a rate.sleep() to do
    #    a periodic action.
    #rospy.spin()
